# Budget Tracker CLI

A Python CLI tool for connecting to your RBC bank account via Plaid and pulling monthly statements.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies with Poetry:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Configure Plaid API:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` with your Plaid credentials from [Plaid Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/):
   ```env
   PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   PLAID_SECRET=your_secret_here
   PLAID_PUBLIC_TOKEN_URL=https://secure.plaid.com/hl/
   ACCOUNT_TO_FILTER=RBC ION+ Visa
   ```

## Usage Flow

### Step 1: Link Your RBC Account

```bash
poetry run budget-tracker link
```

This generates a Plaid Link URL and opens it in your browser:
```
🔗 Link Token Created Successfully!
Link Token: link-sandbox-abc123...

📋 Next Steps:
1. Go to: https://secure.plaid.com/hl/abc123...
2. Select 'Royal Bank of Canada' from the institution list
3. For SANDBOX testing, use these credentials:
   Username: user_good
   Password: pass_good
4. Complete the linking process
5. Copy the public_token from the browser network tab
6. Use it with: budget-tracker exchange <public_token>

🌐 Opening Plaid Link in your browser...
```

### Step 2: Complete Account Linking in Browser

1. **Browser will open automatically** to the Plaid Link page
2. **Select "Royal Bank of Canada"** from the institution list
3. **Enter sandbox credentials:**
   - Username: `user_good`
   - Password: `pass_good`
4. **Select your accounts** and complete the linking process

### Step 3: Extract Public Token from Network Tab

**This is the critical step!** After successful linking:

1. **Keep browser DevTools open** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. **Go to Network tab** in DevTools
3. **Complete the Plaid linking flow** 
4. **Look through the network requests** (usually one of the last 2-3 requests)
5. **Find a request with response containing `public_token`**
6. **Copy the public token** (starts with `public-sandbox-` or `public-development-`)

**Pro tip:** The public token is usually in a POST request response after you click "Continue" or "Done" in the Plaid interface.

### Step 4: Exchange Public Token for Access Token

```bash
poetry run budget-tracker exchange public-sandbox-abc123def456ghi789...
```

Expected output:
```
Exchanging public token...
✅ Success! Your RBC account is now linked and ready to use.
Item ID: item-abc123...

🎉 You can now pull your statements with: budget-tracker pull
```

### Step 5: Pull Bank Statements

```bash
# Pull current month statements
poetry run budget-tracker pull

# Pull specific month (YYYY-MM format)
poetry run budget-tracker pull --month 2025-01
```

Expected output:
```
📊 Fetching transactions from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31...
✅ Found 15 transactions for 2024-01

{
  "month": "2024-01",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "Savings",
      "type": "depository",
      "balance": 1500.25
    }
  ],
  "transactions": [
    {
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "description": "Tim Hortons",
      "amount": -4.50,
      "category": "FOOD_AND_DRINK"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "totalIncome": 2500.00,
    "totalExpenses": 856.75,
    "netAmount": 1643.25,
    "transactionCount": 15
  }
}
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `poetry run budget-tracker link` | Generate Plaid Link URL for account connection |
| `poetry run budget-tracker exchange <token>` | Exchange public token for access token |
| `poetry run budget-tracker pull` | Pull current month's transactions |
| `poetry run budget-tracker pull --month YYYY-MM` | Pull specific month's transactions |

## Troubleshooting

### "No linked account found"
- Make sure you completed the `exchange` step after linking
- Your access token is stored in `~/.budget-tracker/access-token.json`

### "Error creating link token"
- Check your `.env` file has correct Plaid credentials
- Ensure `PLAID_ENV=sandbox` for testing

### "Failed to pull statements"
- Your access token may have expired
- Re-run the linking and exchange process
- Check that your Plaid account is active

### Browser Link Not Working
- Ensure you're using the exact URL provided by the link command
- Try opening in an incognito/private browser window

- Never commit your `.env` file or share your Plaid credentials
- Use sandbox environment for testing
- Production tokens have stricter security requirements
